We design almost everything mobile-first these days. What does that mean? Well, it means that we consider tablet views when we're laying out an interface. If you've got a client with tons of mobile and tablet participants, they'll get the same experience (or an even better one) than the classic desktop pax. Plus, we can make everything totally scalable and responsive so it'll work on phones as well.
